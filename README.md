# WBS Management System

A sophisticated project management application designed for managing Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in engineering and construction projects.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Item Management
- Manage project items with detailed attributes (Job No, Function/Group codes, Cost Elements)
- Advanced data table with inline editing and validation
- Virtual scrolling for handling large datasets (100K+ items)
- Real-time filtering and sorting capabilities
- Column-specific input types (text, number, dropdown)

### ðŸ‘¥ Vendor Assignment
- Package-based vendor assignment system
- Master vendor database with comprehensive vendor details
- Drag-and-drop vendor assignment to project packages
- Multi-vendor selection and bulk operations
- Vendor status tracking (Active, Inactive, Pending)

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- Type-safe with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Accessible UI components built with Radix UI
- Performance optimized for enterprise-scale data
- Component-driven development with Storybook
- Mobile-responsive design

## Key Components

- **ItemTable**: Advanced data table with virtual scrolling and inline editing
- **VendorAssignment**: Vendor management and assignment interface
- **UI Components**: Accessible, reusable components built with Radix UI

## Business Context

This application is designed for engineering and construction project management, where:

- Projects are broken down into work packages using WBS methodology
- Items represent work elements with specific classifications and cost tracking
- Vendors are assigned to packages for project execution
- Cost elements track different expense categories (material, labor, equipment)
- IBS codes categorize building system components
